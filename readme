Plant Disease Detection System for Sustainable Agriculture

Project Overview :
This project, Plant Disease Detection System for Sustainable Agriculture, leverages cutting-edge machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies to identify diseases in plants.
The primary goal is to aid farmers in maintaining crop health, improving agricultural sustainability, and minimizing the use of harmful pesticides by early detection of plant diseases.

Internship Program :
This project is undertaken as part of the AICTE Internship on AI: Transformative Learning, conducted under the TechSaksham initiativeâ€”a collaborative Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) program by Microsoft and SAP.

Mentor :
P. RajaProject guidance and mentorship were provided by P. Raja, whose expertise in artificial intelligence and agriculture was invaluable in shaping the project.

Features :
Automated Disease Detection: Identifies diseases from images of plant leaves.
Machine Learning Models: Implements convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification.
Sustainability Focus: Promotes sustainable farming by reducing the reliance on chemical treatments.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use application for farmers and agricultural experts.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Frameworks and Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
Tools: Jupyter Notebook, GitHub
Dataset: Publicly available datasets of plant leaf images with labeled diseases
